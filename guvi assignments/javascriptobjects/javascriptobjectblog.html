      Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the
      building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different
      from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null,
      undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types
      all store a single value each (depending on their types).
    </p>

    <p>
      Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of
      these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is
      a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are
      given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer
      points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables
      don’t actually store the value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered
      collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form
      of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are
      called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name,
      age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects and properties</h2>
    <p>
      A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an
      object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
      Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables,
      except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define
      the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object
      with a simple dot-notation:
    </p>

    <p class="imm">objectName.propertyName</p>

    <p>
      Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a
      normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a
      property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object
      named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="imm">
      var myCar = new Object(); myCar.make = 'Ford'; <br />myCar.model =
      'Mustang';<br />
      myCar.year = 1969;
    </p>
    <p>Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).</p>

    <p class="imm">myCar.color; // undefined</p>
    <p>
      Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a
      bracket notation (for more details see property accessors). Objects are
      sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated
      with a string value that can be used to access it. So, for example, you
      could access the properties of the myCar object as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      myCar['make'] = 'Ford';<br />
      myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';<br />
      myCar['year'] = 1969;
    </p>
    <p>
      An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything
      that can be converted to a string, including the empty string. However,
      any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for example,
      a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a
      number) can only be accessed using the square bracket notation. This
      notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically
      determined (when the property name is not determined until runtime).
      Examples are as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="imm">
      // four variables are created and assigned in a single go, <br />//
      separated by commas<br />
      var myObj = new Object(),<br />
      str = 'myString', <br />rand = Math.random(),<br />
      obj = new Object();<br />
      myObj.type = 'Dot syntax';<br />
      myObj['date created'] = 'String with space'; <br />myObj[str] = 'String
      value'; <br />myObj[rand] = 'Random Number';<br />
      myObj[obj] = 'Object'; <br />myObj[''] = 'Even an empty string';<br />console.log(myObj);
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a
      variable:
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      var propertyName = 'make';<br />
      myCar[propertyName] = 'Ford';propertyName = 'model';<br />
      myCar[propertyName] = 'Mustang';
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the bracket notation with for...in to iterate over all the
      enumerable properties of an object. To illustrate how this works, the
      following function displays the properties of the object when you pass the
      object and the object's name as arguments to the function:
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      function showProps(obj, objName) {<br />
      var result = ``;<br />
      for (var i in obj) {<br />
      // obj.hasOwnProperty() is used to filter out properties from the object's
      prototype chain<br />
      if (obj.hasOwnProperty(i)) {<br />
      result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\n`;<br />
      }<br />
      }<br />
      return result;<br />
      }
    </p>

    <p>
      So, the function call showProps(myCar, "myCar") would return the
      following:
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      myCar.make = Ford<br />
      myCar.model = Mustang<br />
      myCar.year = 1969
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Objects In JavaScript :</h2>
    <h2>Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal</h2>
    <p>
      One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply
      define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
    </p>
    <h2>Create JavaScript Object with Constructor</h2>
    <p>
      Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword,
      constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as
      shown below
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      function Vehicle(name, maker) {<br />
      this.name = name;<br />
      this.maker = maker;<br />
      }<br />
      let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);<br />
      let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)<br />
      console.log(car1.name); //Output: Fiesta<br />
      console.log(car2.name); //Output: Santa Fe
    </p>
    <h2>Using the JavaScript Keyword new</h2>
    <p>
      The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four
      properties:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong><br /></p>
    <p>
      var person = new Object();<br />
      person.firstName = “John”;<br />
      person.lastName = “Doe”;<br />
      person.age = 50;<br />
      person.eyeColor = “blue”;
    </p>
    <h2>Using the Object.create method</h2>
    <p>
      Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method
      can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object
      for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor
      function.
    </p>
    <p class="imm">
      // Animal properties and method encapsulation<br />
      var Animal = {<br />
      type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties<br />
      displayType: function() { // Method which will display type of Animal<br />
      console.log(this.type);<br />
      }<br />
      };<br />
      // Create new animal type called animal1 <br />
      var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);<br />
      animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates<br />
      // Create new animal type called Fishes<br />
      var fish = Object.create(Animal);<br />
      fish.type = 'Fishes';<br />
      fish.displayType(); <br /><br />
      // Output:Fishes
    </p>
